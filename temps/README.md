<br> **Goal Word:** spaceship

**Output:**
Let’s talk about politics. You don't sound like a very passionate political figure, I've just been speaking about a little guy who lived in our world. Well, she could say one thing, she could be totally ridiculous and be very wrong, but I was quite angry, i guess. And so, I was very angry but not angry at the same time, even though he said i had done something wrong. And I would sit on my chair and watch him and see what he was reading and then he would play and play and do that and I would listen to that and he would play his guitar again, and I would listen to his playing, and he would play his guitar again and then he would play his little song and you would say oh you are such a little thing you are really pretty you are and then he would play his little song again and then we started laughing and you would say oh you are such a little thing but you only play so nicely, and then there were so many times that I had to stand up and go to the toilet because he would be playing and he would sing a song and I would have to stand up so that the girls would all stand up and I had to walk back there and then take my seat so that there could be no problems like this. I mean yes we did talk and he would call me "little baby", we would joke about that but i was only sixteen so i didn't have sex with him, yes he told me he loved me more than him, that he was his girlfriend and that he could take good care of me.
